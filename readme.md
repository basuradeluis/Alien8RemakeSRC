Alien 8 was a game made by Ultimate company for home computers like MSX, Spectrum, etc many years ago.

Ignacio Perez Gil made a remake for personal computers, using Allegro libraries and C programing language. Windows and Mac versions available (not in this github repository)

This is the source code of it, with some personal modifications.
It is a mess so donâ–’t expect anything.

 with instructions to compile in Linux (in Spanish)
 It requires Allegro libraries version 4, as far as I remember.
