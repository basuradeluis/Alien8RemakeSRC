Alien 8 was a game made by Ultimate company for home computers like MSX, Spectrum, etc many years ago.

Ignacio Perez Gil made a remake for personal computers, using Allegro libraries. Windows and Mac versions available (not in this github repository)

This is the source code of it, with some personal modifications.
It is a mess so don´t expect anything.

Branch master is the original source code (althought is is better to use the zip files). 

luis1 branch includes my modifications. Because it includes the skill to shoot, you will need the modifyied anims.dat file (815 Kb) with the image of the shoot.

My modifications include: invulnerability, cheats (infinite lives and time, that was already in original source code), options to skip intro, making a temporary block to help, making a shot to kill some enemy (beta), some coments in the code, etc

 with instructions to compile in Linux (in Spanish)
It requires Allegro libraries version 4, as far as I remember.
